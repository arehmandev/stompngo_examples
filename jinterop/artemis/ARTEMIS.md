# Artemis Java / JMS and _stompngo_ Interoperability

## The Included JAR Files

The required JAR files for this are included, see the _jars_ subdirectory.

Learning which JARs to include has been an adventure.  The included JARs
should suffice for many environments.

## Port Numbers

Port numbers (local) are coded on:

* jndi.properties
* gorecv.go
* gosend.go

These files likely need to change to fit an indivadual's environment.
